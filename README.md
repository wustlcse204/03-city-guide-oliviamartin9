# Assignment 03: City Guide

For this assignment, you will be creating a simple website to act as a guide to your favorite city. Your website should highlight 4-5 of your favorite places in your favorite city. These can include restaurants, parks, museums, activities, or other features you enjoy about the city.

Your content should be well organized and include many of the HTML elements we have learned so far, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, and semantic text.

## Assignment Objectives

### HTML

1. Look at the `index.html` file and add something that every HTML file needs to have at the very beginning of the file.
2. Include information that is relevant to your users in an appropriate format (i.e. hours of operation, menus, costs, directions).
    * Include at least one list
    * Include at least one table with appropriate content
3. Include images of the city, as well as images of the places you're highlighting. (Make sure you use height and width attributes to size them correctly)
4. Use the [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) editor if needed to resize images to appropriate sizes.
5. Include an appropriate form on your website. This form doesn't need to do anything, so make it whatever you'd like.
6. Structure and format your HTML appropriately, use <div> tags to separate major sections and give each section an appropriate 'id' and 'class' attribute.
7. Create a `<title>` tag
Create a `<meta>` tag with the description of your site for search engines.
8. Leave comments within your HTML
9. Embed a map such as Google Maps on your page. (You can do this via any method, look up on Google Maps how to do this)
10. Use links to navigate within your website, and link to relevant external websites.
11. Once you've finished the HTML for your page, create a style.css file and use a <link> tag to include it in your HTML. Add CSS rules to style the following. You may need to add some ID and CLASS attributes to your HTML to be able to style the elements you need.

### CSS

1. Change some background colors on your page using one of the color formats we learned in class (name, HEX, RGB (or RGBA), HSL (or HSLA)). You can change the background of the entire page, or the background of some elements, or both!
2. Change some text color on your page, using a different color format than you used for the background colors.
3. Change the font of some text on your page
4. Change the font size of some text on your page
5. Change the font weight of some text on your page
6. Make some text on your page either italic, underlined, or all caps using CSS by targeting an ID or CLASS.
7. Add some line height to the paragraphs on your page
8. Change the alignment of some text- left, right, or justify.
9. Change the color of the links on your page, including when they are hovered over.
10. Change the background color of your form text inputs when they are in focus (i.e. when the user is typing a value)
